CLI - command line interface

functions are actions or verbs

arguments are inputs to a functions that influence its behavior

side effects are the products of a function

bugs are a mistake in a program

SyntaxError an error in the coding side


importance of 
- readability
- simiplicity


reasonable people can disagree, but justify


Scope
- variable scope

## 2023.07.02 20:00:00 CS50P - Lecture 01 - Conditionals

>
>=
<
<=
==
!=

if, elif, else, or, and

if, elif, elif, elif, else
can be substituted for 
match - which is like switch

# match is in Python 3.10 and higher


## 2023.07.03 05:51:23 CS50P - Loops

while, for, range, list
dicts
list of dicts
None

dictionary are highly preformant, hashmap

What's good about functions is that you can change
- the underline implementation details 
- as long as you don't change
    - the name of the function
    - its parameter
    - what it returns 

so you can change want happens underneath the hood,
as long as functionality is the same

## 2023.07.03 07:26:00 Lecture 03 - Exception 

Syntax Error - errors in code before run-time

Defensive Programming
need to test Edge Cases or Corner Cases
for integer input
- positive
- zero
- negative
- char or string

return is stronger than break
- they both get you out of a loop 
- but return also returns a value

try, except, else, break, return, pass

set breakpoint

play debug icon

continue, step over, step into, step out

## 2023.07.03 12:15:00 Lecture 04 - Libraries

modules is a library with one or more functions or other features built-in
- reusability of code, factor out code and create a library/module

example libraries that come with python
- random

docs.python.org/3/library/random.html

import keyword
from keyword

command-line arguments

python hello.py ...

- sys

docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html

sys.argv


3rd party modules - packages

pypi
pypi.org

pypi.org/project/cowsay


package manager pip

pip install cowsay

- requests

pypi.org/project/requests

json - language agnostic format for exchanging data, text file in a json format
